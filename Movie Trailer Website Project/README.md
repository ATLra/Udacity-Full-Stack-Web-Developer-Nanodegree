# Fresh Tomatoes
By Rosie Agasarkisian

## Purpose
**Fresh Tomatoes** is Project One in Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. As per the requirements, this project uses Python and html to display information about a number of movies, including data such as: trailers, taglines, posters, and ratings.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 2 to be installed on the user's computer.

## Usage
* Clone repository onto computer
* Using an IDE, open `entertainment_center.py`
* Running `entertainment_center.py` will open a browser window containing the Movie Trailer Website
* Clicking on each movie poster image will open that movie's trailer in a modal dialog window

## Process
This project uses Python in conjunction with HTML to display data on a web page called **Fresh Tomatoes**. Data is stored in arrays within `entertainment_center.py`, which calls the `class Movie()` in `media.py` to produce the information as a web page which is structured in `fresh_tomatoes.py` using CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML.
